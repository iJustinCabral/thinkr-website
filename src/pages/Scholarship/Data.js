    headerBodyText: 'The Lovelace Scholarship Program is designed to benefit underprivileged college students by allowing them to graduate debt free while also providing a monthly living stipend. As the cost of college education continues to rise in the United States, we feel it’s more important than ever to give deserving students a greater chance of success post-graduation by relieving them from the burden of college debt. Not only that, but by paying a monthly living stipend to the students in the program, it will allow them to focus 100% of their time on their schoolwork which will garner better academic results. This scholarship is modeled after the National Science Foundation’s Scholarship for Service program, without all the strings attached. We look forward to changing the lives of every student who is fortunate enough to be part of the Lovelace Scholarship Program.'
