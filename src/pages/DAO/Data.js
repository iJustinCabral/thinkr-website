    headerBodyText: 'The Dreamr DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization that centers around changing the lives of those dedicated to learning. The core mission of The Dreamr DAO is to provide a scholarship and stipend program to underprivileged undergraduate students with the goal of reducing financial burdens that hinder their creativity and productivity. Four of the founders of Thinkr were fortunate enough to be recipients of the National Institute of Science & Technologies Cybercorps Scholarship for Service program. That program was the core inspiration behind this DAO as well as our Lovelace Scholarship, and we look forward to reaching a broader range of students in the long term. '
